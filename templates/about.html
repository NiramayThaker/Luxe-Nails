    <p>Passion, Precision, and Pink.</p>

<!-- Origin Story -->
<div class="about-section">
    <div class="about-content">
        <h2>How It Started</h2>
        <p>LuxeNails was born from a desire to elevate the standard nail salon experience into something truly
            extraordinary. Founded in 2024 by Isabella Rose, a master nail artist with over 15 years of experience, our
            studio was conceived as a sanctuary where art meets self-care.</p>
        <p>Isabella started in a small room in her apartment, fueled by an obsession with perfect cuticles and
            innovative designs. Her reputation for perfection quickly spread, leading to the opening of our flagship
            studio in Beverly Hills.</p>

        <h2>What Inspires Us</h2>
        <p>We draw inspiration from everything around us: modern art, high fashion, nature's textures, and the vibrant
            energy of the city. We believe that nails are a canvas for self-expression, not just a beauty routine.</p>
        <p>Our "pink paradise" aesthetic is inspired by the calming yet playful nature of the color pink—representing
            love, kindness, and femininity in all its forms.</p>

            <h3>3000 BC</h3>
            <p>In ancient China, nail color indicated social status. Royals wore gold and silver, later evolving to
                black and red.</p>

            <h3>19th Century</h3>
